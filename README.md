# IS2101-Assignnent-2---NNM24IS176-Interrupt Controller Simulation in Java
# Introduction
This Java program simulates an Interrupt Controller System that handles interrupts generated by different devices such as a keyboard, mouse, and printer.
The program demonstrates how interrupts are triggered, prioritized, masked, and processed in an operating system–like environment using threads and synchronization.

# Objective
To simulate interrupt handling using Java programming.
To demonstrate interrupt masking, prioritization, and logging.
To understand how threads and synchronization manage concurrent events.

# Description
The program contains two main classes:

1. InterruptController
This class manages:

The interrupt queue (to store incoming interrupts).
The masking mechanism (to enable or disable specific devices).
The ISR handler thread (to process interrupts in priority order).
The log (to store handled interrupts and timestamps).
Key methods:

triggerInterrupt() – Simulates interrupt generation by a device.
setMask() – Masks or unmasks interrupts for a device.
startISRHandler() – Starts the background thread that handles interrupts.
printLog() – Prints all processed interrupts.

2. Main
This class:

Creates an InterruptController object.
Starts the interrupt service routine handler.
Randomly triggers interrupts from devices.
Displays the interrupt handling log after execution.
How the Program Works
Interrupts are randomly generated from devices.
If a device is unmasked, its interrupt is added to the queue.
The controller sorts the queue based on device priority.
A background thread processes interrupts one by one.
Each handled interrupt is logged with timestamps.
